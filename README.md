The Double-Alt modifier is activated by pressing Alt twice, much like a double-click. Hold the second press down until you click.

The shortcuts:

Alt + Left Button : Drag to move a window.

Alt + Right Button : Drag to resize a window.

Double-Alt + Left Button : Minimize a window.

Double-Alt + Right Button : Maximize/Restore a window.

Double-Alt + Middle Button : Close a window.
